# Ams Docs

This uses mdx (markdown extended). It let's you do stuff like

```
# Some markdown title

some markdown text

<Button>boom, jsx in markdown</Button>
```

# Contribute

1. Create a `.mdx` file in the pages directory, it will automatically create a route under /your-filename
2. Write your content, you can check the `select.mdx` file to see an example
3. add a new link to your page to the `components/layout.js` file
